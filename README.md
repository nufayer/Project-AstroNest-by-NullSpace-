Project-AstroNest-by-NullSpace-


AstroNest is a browser-based, gamified platform for designing space habitats. Users learn core principles, build layouts with real-time NASA data feedback, and explore AI-driven future tools for optimized, human-friendly extraterrestrial homes.

Project Overview

AstroNest is an interactive, browser-based tool for designing sustainable and efficient space habitats. It provides a gamified, data-driven platform for users of all levels—from students to aerospace engineers and astronauts—to design, simulate, and explore habitat layouts for orbital and planetary environments. Real-time NASA data integration ensures scientifically valid and mission-ready designs.

Core Concept: Drag-and-drop interface for designing and simulating space habitats Primary Goal: Make space habitat design accessible, educational, and collaborative Target Audience: Enthusiastic learners, aerospace engineers, mission planners, astronauts
